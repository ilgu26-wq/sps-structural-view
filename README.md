## What This Repository Is

- Static deployment of a structural system view
- No training, no optimization, no execution
- Observation-only surface

The HTML page is the **authoritative view**.  
This repository only anchors and serves it.

## SOAR — EXIT ABLATION STUDY  
**Structural Evidence of Core Invariance (Prop-Oriented)**

This section documents an **execution-only ablation** conducted to verify  
whether observed performance limits originated from:

- core judgment (alpha selection), or  
- execution mechanics (alpha realization)

No learning, no optimization, and no structural modification were introduced.

---

### Verdict

**CASE 1 — EXIT Problem (Not Core)**

> The structural alpha was correct.  
> The execution layer released it too early.

---

### Experimental Design

- **Core**: SOAR1 (fixed, sealed)
- **Entry logic**: identical across all tests
- **Market data**: identical
- **Variable**: EXIT logic only

This isolates execution effects while holding  
the judgment surface strictly invariant.

---

### Results Summary

| EXIT Pattern | Win Rate | RR | Expectancy | Equity | Max DD |
|-------------|----------|----|------------|--------|--------|
| A (Baseline) | 82.2% | 0.99 | +1.21 | +606R | -8R |
| B (Extended τ) | **89.0%** | **2.24** | **+3.66** | **+1832R** | **-5R** |
| C (Aggressive) | 93.2% | 2.40 | +4.31 | +2155R | -4R |

---

### Structural Observations

#### 1. Core Judgment Remains Valid
- Win rate consistently exceeds **80%**
- Entry quality does not degrade
- Structural opportunity identification is stable

#### 2. Performance Was EXIT-Constrained
- EXIT-A truncated structure prematurely
- EXIT-B respected structural persistence (τ)
- Expectancy tripled **without touching the core**

#### 3. Longer τ Improved Both RR and Win Rate

| Pattern | Avg Structural Hold (τ) |
|-------|--------------------------|
| A | 6.3 bars |
| B | 8.6 bars |
| C | 9.9 bars |

Premature exits discarded valid alpha mass  
while structure remained intact.

#### 4. Drawdown Improvement Confirms Alignment
- Max DD reduced from **-8R → -5R**
- Fewer re-entries and structural violations
- EXIT-B aligns with persistence, not prediction

#### 5. Aggressive EXIT (C) Is Non-Prop-Stable
- Highest expectancy
- Structural validity collapses (37.5%)
- Suitable for research, not evaluation regimes

---

### Conclusion

> **The core did not improve.  
> The execution finally stopped interfering.**

This ablation confirms:

- Performance limits were **execution-induced**
- SOAR1 judgment was already correct
- EXIT is the primary leverage surface

---

### Action (Structural Implication)

- Keep SOAR1 **sealed**
- Modify execution surface only
- Treat EXIT as a realization operator, not a decision

This repository records the surface.  
The HTML view displays it.  
No behavior is produced here.

## ⚠️ Important Explanation — Purpose of This Section

This section is included to **clearly explain the nature of the *growing* SOAR core**  
maintained in this repository, by **explicitly contrasting it** with a  
**sealed and invariant SOAR core (SOAR1)** used **only as a reference baseline**.

In other words, the purpose of this description is to distinguish between:

- a **growing / adaptive SOAR system** (the primary subject of this repository), and  
- a **sealed, non-growing SOAR core (SOAR1)** used for structural comparison.

---

### About the Reference Core (SOAR1)

Whenever **SOAR1** is mentioned in this SPS, it refers to a  
**deliberately sealed baseline core** with the following properties:

- ❌ No self-improvement  
- ❌ No recursive learning  
- ❌ No evolutionary core updates  

This is **not a claim that this repository does not support growth**.  
It is a **structural baseline choice** made to clearly demonstrate  
**what growth adds and where it occurs**.

---

### The Actual Subject of This Repository: Growing SOAR

The system developed and documented here is a **growing SOAR architecture**:

- capable of structural adaptation through observation  
- supporting multi-core expansion and interaction  
- separating execution, interpretation, and growth layers  

The sealed SOAR1 baseline exists **only to clarify**:

- what remains invariant,
- what evolves over time, and
- where structural growth is introduced.

---

## What This SPS Actually Shows

This SPS (Structural Projection Surface):

- places a **fixed SOAR1 reference core** on the surface,
- projects the behavior of the **growing SOAR system** around it, and
- makes the following distinctions observable:

- performance limits did **not** originate from core judgment,
- execution layers formed the primary bottleneck,
- growth operates outside the invariant decision core.

These distinctions are **intentional and explanatory**.

> Growth is defined **relative to a fixed reference**.  
> This surface provides that reference.

---

## Structural Role of This Repository

This repository exists to:

- center the **growing SOAR core** as the main subject,
- anchor a **sealed reference core (SOAR1)** for comparison, and
- make explicit the difference between:
  - **core invariance**, and
  - **system-level growth introduced elsewhere in the architecture**.

If you are looking for:

- conventional machine learning systems,
- single-agent adaptive models,
- recursive self-training architectures,

those belong to **a different conceptual lineage**.

This surface exists for **structural comparison and verification of growth**.
