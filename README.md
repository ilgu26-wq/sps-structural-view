## What This Repository Is

- Static deployment of a structural system view
- No training, no optimization, no execution
- Observation-only surface

The HTML page is the **authoritative view**.  
This repository only anchors and serves it.

## SOAR — EXIT ABLATION STUDY  
**Structural Evidence of Core Invariance (Prop-Oriented)**

This section documents an **execution-only ablation** conducted to verify  
whether observed performance limits originated from:

- core judgment (alpha selection), or  
- execution mechanics (alpha realization)

No learning, no optimization, and no structural modification were introduced.

---

### Verdict

**CASE 1 — EXIT Problem (Not Core)**

> The structural alpha was correct.  
> The execution layer released it too early.

---

### Experimental Design

- **Core**: SOAR1 (fixed, sealed)
- **Entry logic**: identical across all tests
- **Market data**: identical
- **Variable**: EXIT logic only

This isolates execution effects while holding  
the judgment surface strictly invariant.

---

### Results Summary

| EXIT Pattern | Win Rate | RR | Expectancy | Equity | Max DD |
|-------------|----------|----|------------|--------|--------|
| A (Baseline) | 82.2% | 0.99 | +1.21 | +606R | -8R |
| B (Extended τ) | **89.0%** | **2.24** | **+3.66** | **+1832R** | **-5R** |
| C (Aggressive) | 93.2% | 2.40 | +4.31 | +2155R | -4R |

---

### Structural Observations

#### 1. Core Judgment Remains Valid
- Win rate consistently exceeds **80%**
- Entry quality does not degrade
- Structural opportunity identification is stable

#### 2. Performance Was EXIT-Constrained
- EXIT-A truncated structure prematurely
- EXIT-B respected structural persistence (τ)
- Expectancy tripled **without touching the core**

#### 3. Longer τ Improved Both RR and Win Rate

| Pattern | Avg Structural Hold (τ) |
|-------|--------------------------|
| A | 6.3 bars |
| B | 8.6 bars |
| C | 9.9 bars |

Premature exits discarded valid alpha mass  
while structure remained intact.

#### 4. Drawdown Improvement Confirms Alignment
- Max DD reduced from **-8R → -5R**
- Fewer re-entries and structural violations
- EXIT-B aligns with persistence, not prediction

#### 5. Aggressive EXIT (C) Is Non-Prop-Stable
- Highest expectancy
- Structural validity collapses (37.5%)
- Suitable for research, not evaluation regimes

### Conclusion

> **The core did not improve.  
> The execution finally stopped interfering.**

This ablation confirms:

- Performance limits were **execution-induced**
- SOAR1 judgment was already correct
- EXIT is the primary leverage surface

---

### Action (Structural Implication)

- Keep SOAR1 **sealed**
- Modify execution surface only
- Treat EXIT as a realization operator, not a decision

This repository records the surface.  
The HTML view displays it.  
No behavior is produced here.

---

## ⚠️ Important Clarification — This Is NOT the Growing SOAR

This repository does **not** represent the *growing* or *adaptive* SOAR system.

- ❌ No self-improvement
- ❌ No recursive learning
- ❌ No evolutionary core updates

The SOAR referenced here is a **sealed, invariant core (SOAR1)**  
used **only as a structural reference**.

Growth, adaptation, and multi-core evolution  
(if present elsewhere) belong to **a different SOAR lineage**  
and are **intentionally excluded** from this surface.

---

### What This SPS Actually Shows

- A **fixed SOAR core**, already decided
- A **structural projection surface** built *around* it
- Evidence that:
  - performance limits did **not** originate from the core
  - execution layers were the bottleneck
  - core judgment remained valid without modification

This separation is deliberate.

> Growth happens **outside** this surface.  
> Truth is observed **inside** it.

---

### Structural Role of This Repository

This repository exists to:

- anchor a **non-growing, non-adaptive SOAR core**
- expose its behavior through a **static structural surface**
- prevent confusion between:
  - **core invariance**, and
  - **system-level growth elsewhere**

If you are looking for:
- learning systems
- adaptive agents
- recursive intelligence

You are in the **wrong repository**.

This surface is for **structural truth only**.

## Status

- Execution: ❌ none  
- Learning: ❌ none  
- Interpretation: ❌ none  
- Structural display: ✅ enabled
